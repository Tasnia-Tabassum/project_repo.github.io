         <h1 style="color:rgb(192, 212, 7);font-size:18px;"> The Padma Multipurpose Bridge is a multipurpose road-rail bridge across the Padma River, the main distributary of Ganges, under construction in Bangladesh with its own resources. It connects Louhajong, Munshiganj to Shariatpur and Madaripur, linking the south-west of the country, to northern and eastern regions. Padma Multipurpose Bridge is considered to be the most challenging construction project in the history of Bangladesh. The two-level steel truss bridge carries a four-lane highway on the upper level and a single track railway on a lower level. The bridge with 150.12 m (492.5 ft) long 41 spans, 6.150 km (3.821 mi) total length and 22.5 m (74 ft) width, is the longest bridge in Bangladesh, and the longest over Ganges in terms of both span and the total length. The highest depth of pile of this bridge is 122 metre, which is highest among all other bridges.Padma Multipurpose Bridge, when commissioned, is expected to boost the GDP of Bangladesh by as much as 1.2 percent!

    <h1 class="heading" style="color: rgb(133, 228, 9);"> Economic impact </h1>

   <p  style="color:rgb(2, 224, 187);font-size:18px;">The construction of the bridge will have a huge economic impact on the country. In an analysis or study report by Maunsell, the bridge's design consultant, in 2010, the bridge's Benefit-Cost Ratio (BCR) was 1.6 per cent and the Economic Internal Rate of Return (ERR) was 18 per cent. Add the cost of bridge construction. The BCR will be 2.1 and ERR 22 per cent. In other words, construction of this bridge will be economically profitable. Dhaka's communication with 21 southern districts will be reduced by 2 to 4 hours. The direct connectivity with the capital will help expand trade and commerce, ease supply of raw materials and industrialization. Small and big industries will be set up in the 21 districts. Agriculture will greatly improve. Farmers will get better commodity prices. Production will increase.

    In addition to the design consultants, the World Bank's independent consultants and the consultancy firm employed by the Bridges Division have analyzed the economic impact of the bridge. According to the survey report, the economic impact of the bridge will help increase the annual GDP of the south by 2.0 per cent and the overall GDP of the country by more than 1.0 per cent. The construction of the bridge will improve the integrated communication structure of the country. The southern part of the country will get connected to the Trans-Asian Highway (N-8) and the Trans-Asian Railway. Bangladesh will have international connectivity with India, Bhutan and Nepal. Economic zones, high-tech parks and private industrial cities will be built on both sides of the bridge. Investment and employment will increase.
    
    Mongla and Payra seaports will be operational. The tourism industry will flourish and new and old tourist destinations, including Kuakata beach in the southern region, the Sundarbans, the sixty-domed mosque, Bangabandhu Mazar in Tungipara, old and new resorts at Mawa and Jazira will attract domestic and foreign tourists. According to the 2010 estimates, 12,000 vehicles were crossing the Padma river. The traffic can double, if the bridge is opened and the number of vehicles will increase by 7-8 per cent every year and by 2050, 67,000 vehicles will run.</p>
